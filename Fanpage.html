    <h3>5 things you might not know about Radiohead</h3>
    <div>
     <ol>
      <li>Radiohead's debut album 'Pablo Honey' was marketed by their US label at the Beavis & Butt-head "slacker" generation. A print ad at the time read: "Radiohead - better than Butt-head! Oxford England's rowdiest new band. Huh-huh-huh, music that doesn't suck. Featuring the self-loathing anthem 'Creep'." Oh dear...
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Did you know Radiohead once covered Oasis' 'Wonderwall' during a US radio session? It's not the only wacky cover version they've done - search YouTube for their rendition of Glen Campbell's 'Rhinestone Cowboy'. It's actually really good.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Radiohead met in the '80s as fellow pupils at an all-boys public school, the Abingdon School, in Oxfordshire. Ubiquitous TV comic David Mitchell went to the same school - he was a few years below.</li>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>The noises you hear at the beginning of "The Bends" are from a rowdy group of kids who were practicing with different instruments outside the hotel where the album was recorded. When he heard the racket, Thom Yorke ran downstairs to record them.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Thom Yorke recorded the vocals of "Planet Telex" while lying on the floor. He was extremely drunk on wine.
